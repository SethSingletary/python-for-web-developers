Reflection Questions:

1. Storing local files allows you to have persistant, local data and store information offline.

2. Pickles are a way of compressing files and storing them. I would almost always use them, since its a more efficient way to store data

4. I would you a try block so that it would instead run my except code

5. So far it is going good. I'm happy that I've learned of storing data locally. I want to build an app for people with DID so being able
to build my outline of that locally in python will be amazing
